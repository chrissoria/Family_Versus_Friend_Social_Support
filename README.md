WHY PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE SUPPORT or WHO GETS HELPED AND WHY (rough titles)
Outline Draft #1
September 22, 2023
C.S.F.


Basic idea of the paper: Empirically, use the open-ended answers to e1b/e2b to (a) come up with a descriptive taxonomy of the reasons people (i.e., respondents to UCNets) think they can count on serious support from family and from friends; (b) compare the rationales for friends vs family; (c) describe what sorts of people (by age, gender, education, ethnicity, marital-partner status (including divorced), distance of kin, net size, mode, maybe loquaciousness, maybe interviewer code……) report which sorts of reasons. Draw implications for the study of networks and support.

Sequence of analysis: * Reduce, blend categories in e1b, e2b to much fewer; * Use reduced categories to see which elicited by confidence, which by lack-of-confidence in help; * What can we say about the connection between ego (and other) traits and the answers to e1b, e2b? (May need to do within levels of e1a, e2a); * What’s the connection between e1b and e2b? (and connection independent of ego traits?)


	Introduction
o	The research question(s).
	What determines support / expectation of support? (Re: family, Silverstein 2002 differentiates investment v. insurance v. altruism explanations]
•	Reciprocity is mentioned in the literature.
o	Studies that see whether reciprocity is predictive.
•	Norms…
o	Responding to need level implies normative rule (see lit.).
o	Lit on filial norms (e.g., Gans & Silverstein 2006)
	Perhaps note on frequency of failure to support (Campbell 2020, plus Offer, etc.)
o	Importance; what’s missing in the literature
o	Current contribution
	Uniqueness of the data
•	Rs’ explaining of support understanding—and in their own words.
	We help clarify conceptualization—what these answers represent. (More in Appendix.)
	Describe rationales:
•	Evaluate rationales in the literature—reciprocity, norms, x, y, z
•	But add ones not in the literature---maybe: affection, personal traits, …..
	Weigh importance of rationales, correlates, etc.
	Reveal existence/extent of avoiding asking or being unable to ask for support
•	E.g., issues of helpers’ capacities; estrangement; obligation
	Literature
o	Limitations
	Skimpy
	Largely infers “rules” from reported support.
	Samples overwhelmingly of the elderly
o	General lit on who gets/gives support.
	Family
•	Family patterns (e.g., which relations; implicit rules
•	Class effects
•	Specific lit on what people say about it – quite limited in number, sample sizes, diversity of egos.
o	Mazelis and Mykyta; Gans; Napolitano; Ezell
	Friends
o	Conclusions from the lit
o	UCNets value added preview
	Method
o	UCNets Data
	Explain project.
•	Sample
o	Address issue of representativeness: not representative nationally but reasonable locally for two cohorts. Don’t claim that the distribution is generalizable but do identify variation.
•	Including FTF v web; transcripts available; etc., as well as standard stuff like sample and procedure.
	The key questions
o	Frame more precisely the research question(s)
o	Overview of analysis – much more to be in appendix(ces)
	(Important to explain the multiple coding procedure and how answers can get multiple codes.)
	Results
o	Intro: Strategy of presentation
o	Family
	Distribution of results on e1a
•	Correlates of answers by R traits (could eventually be in appendix)
	Description of final, condensed coding scheme; distribution
	Coding categories X e1a
	Who gives what kinds of answers?
•	E1b answers X respondent traits
o	Just descriptive or do we use modeling to identify key predictors?
o	Sources of variation:
	Answering styles (reticent vs talky) and other personality features
	Interviewer (where there is one)
	Social situation (married; relatives alive….)
	Demographics
o	(Q: Perhaps these analyses should be done within levels of e1a—e.g., (A) definitely + probably and (B) Other. Or Definitely vs any other answers?)
o	Friends
	Distribution of results on e2a
•	Correlates of answers by R traits (could eventually be in appendix)
	Description of final, condensed coding scheme; distribution
	Coding categories X e2a
	Who gives what kinds of answers?
•	E2b answers X respondent traits
o	Just descriptive or do we use modeling to identify key predictors?
o	Sources of variation (see above)
o	Family X Friends
	What’s the connection between e1ab and e2b answers?
	Are there similarities, implying types of people have types of orientations to network support? (Or, are the family/friends evaluated independently?)
o	Maybe: What happens when evaluation changes between waves? Analysis of e1c, e2c.
	Discussion
o	Recap
o	Limitations
	Conclusion
	APPENDIX(ICES)
o	More detailed explanation of:
	Nature of the data
•	E.g., interview dynamics; possible sources of error….
	Repeat below for family and for friends
	Coding procedures
•	Generating the categories
•	Including the multiple coding strategy.
	Coding schemes
•	Description of …
•	Issues with ... and decisions
	How we reduced categories to fewer number for analysis.
•	(Here I have a vague sense of some sort of [guided] data-reduction algorithm. If, people who answer X also pretty much answer Y, should we fold X and Y into one category?)
•	Descriptions of each of the reduced
o	More detailed tables (and present reduced form in text)
